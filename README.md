Budget Tracker
A simple command-line-based budget tracker built with Python. This program allows users to track their income, expenses, set a budget goal, and view a summary of their financial activity. The interface is user-friendly and easy to use for basic financial tracking.

Features
Track Income: Add multiple sources of income along with the amounts.
Track Expenses: Record expenses under different categories like groceries, rent, or entertainment.
Set a Budget Goal: Define a budget goal, and the program will notify you if you exceed it.
View Budget Summary: Get a detailed summary of your total income, total expenses, remaining budget, and whether you've surpassed your budget goal.
Clear Screen: The program clears the screen after each action to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

How It Works
Add Income: You can specify the income amount and source (e.g., salary, freelance work).
Add Expenses: You can specify the expense amount and category (e.g., rent, groceries).
Set a Budget Goal: You can set a goal, and the program will warn you if your expenses exceed that goal.
View a Summary: See your total income, total expenses, remaining budget, and check whether you've exceeded the budget goal.
Exit: The program can be closed through the menu option.
